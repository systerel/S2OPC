# Script to build the S2OPC project:
#
# Options:
# - Variable CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE set with filename of toolchain config in root directory
# - Variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS set to compile the shared library instead of static one
# - Variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX set to configure the install prefix of cmake
#
# Steps:
# - generate build information
# - configure build with cmake
# - build the library and tests
# - prepare test execution
