    - CMakeLists.txt: maybe we can use options in our Makfile to call cmake?

- about submodules:

    - how does Systerel manage check and mbedtls libraries
      (especially in their CI)?

- skip tests_make_suite_logger (new in v0.5.0): see if we can put it back,
  but we then have to:

    - remove our ifdef in csrc/helpers/sopc_log_manager.c,
    - have precise dates to build the log string (and filename)
    - use tis-mkfs to be able to open the log file.
