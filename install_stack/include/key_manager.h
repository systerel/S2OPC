 *
 * The KeyManager provides an API for Asymmetric Key Management such as loading signed public keys (Certificate)
 * and the corresponding private key.
 *
 * KeyManager is different than PKIProvider, which only handles signed public key validation and storage.
 *
 * KeyManager API is context-less. The KeyManager is generic, and is not linked to the current security policy.
