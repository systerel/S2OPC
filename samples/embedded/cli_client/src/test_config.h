 * \brief Provides a cache for data values.
 *
 * This cached is based on a SOPC_Dict whose keys are SOPC_NodeId and values are SOPC_DataVariant.
 * Functions Cache_GetSourceVariables and Cache_SetTargetVariables are callback that interface PubSub with the cache.
 *
 * For now, this cache uses a single Mutex to assert that only one thread writes or read.
 * This could be enhanced with the use of a read/write double buffer for instance.
