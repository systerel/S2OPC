 * \brief Parses a numeric range as described in Part 4 ยง 7.22

 * \param range   the string describing the range
 * \param result  the allocated parsed range in case of success, or NULL in case
 *                of failure
 *
 * \return \c SOPC_STATUS_OK in case of success, or an error code in case of
 *         failure.
 *
 * The specification does not explicitly tell on how many bits range bounds are
 * to be encoded. Array/string/bytestring sizes in OPC-UA are 32 bit signed
 * integers. In order to reflect the positive nature of range bounds while
 * covering the range of valid value sizes and minimizing memory usage, we use
 * unsigned 32 bit integers for range bounds. Passing range bounds that don't
 * fit in an unsigned 32 bit integer will make this function return
 * \c SOPC_STATUS_NOK .
