/**
 * \brief           Creates a SOPC_PKIProviderStack using lists of paths.
 *
 *                  This verifies the certificate in the safest manner (whole certificate chain, with date validation,
 *                  mandatory certificate revocation lists).
 *                  Certificate Authority (CA) requirements (such as the hash algorithm used for the signature)
 *                  depend on the chosen OPC UA security policy.
 *
 *                  There are 3 types of certificates to provide to the PKI:
 *                  - The "trusted issuers" are CAs which issued certificates are also trusted.
 *                    All the certificates of the signing chain including the root CA must be provided.
 *                  - The "issued certificates" are certificates issued by untrusted CA.
 *                    These certificates are considered trustworthy.
 *                    The difference between trusted issuers and trusted issued certificates is that issued
 *                    certificates are trusted on a one by one basis, whereas the trusted issuer may emit a large
 *                    number of trusted certificates.
 *                  - The "untrusted issuers" are CAs that are used to verify the signing chain of the
 *                    "issued certificates". Each issued certificate must have its whole signing CA chain in the
 *                    untrusted issuers or the trusted issuers up to the root CA.
 *
 *                  In addition, there are two more concepts:
 *                  - A link CA is part of the certificate validation chain.
 *                    All links between a certificate and a root certificate must be provided.
 *                  - A root CA is all always trusted, even if there are other root CAs that signed it.
 *                    Hence the parent of root CAs will never be checked, and the validation stops on root CAs.
 *
 *                  The list of Certificate Revocation List (CRL) must contain exactly one list for each CA of the
 *                  provided CAs, either link or root, trusted or untrusted.
 *
 *                  Issued certificates should not have CRLs, as they cannot be used to trust any other certificate.
 *                  When an issued certificate is used to protect a Secure Channel, it's signing chain will be verified.
 *                  For instance, if the certificate is not self signed and appears on the CRL of its signing CA,
 *                  the connection will fail as the certificate is in fact invalid.
 *
 * \param lPathTrustedIssuerRoots   A pointer to an array of paths to root trusted issuers of the validation chains.
 *                  The array must contain a NULL pointer to indicate its end.
 *                  Each path is a zero-terminated relative path to the certificate from the current working directory.
 * \param lPathTrustedIssuerLinks   A pointer to an array of paths to intermediate certificate authorities.
 *                  This list contain only the trusted intermediate issuers.
 *                  This list must be ordered so that certificate signed by a parent must be present in the list
 *                  before its signing parent.
 *                  Each issued certificate must have its signing certificate chain in this list.
 * \param lPathUntrustedIssuerRoots A pointer to an array of paths to root untrusted issuers of the validation chains.
 *                  The array must contain a NULL pointer to indicate its end.
 *                  Each path is a zero-terminated relative path to the certificate from the current working directory.
 * \param lPathUntrustedIssuerLinks A pointer to an array of paths to intermediate certificate authorities.
 *                  This list contain only the untrusted intermediate issuers.
 *                  This list must be ordered so that certificate signed by a parent must be present in the list
 *                  before its signing parent.
 *                  Each issued certificate must have its signing certificate chain in this list.
 * \param lPathIssuedCerts  A pointer to an array of paths to issued certificates.
 *                  The array must contain a NULL pointer to indicate its end.
 *                  Each path is a zero-terminated relative path to the certificate from the current working directory.
 * \param lPathCRL  A pointer to an array of paths to each certificate revocation list to use.
 *                  Each CA of the trusted issuers list and the untrusted issuers list must have a CRL in the list.
 *                  The array must contain a NULL pointer to indicate its end.
 *                  Each path is a zero-terminated relative path to the CRL from the current working directory.
 * \param ppPKI     A valid pointer to the newly created PKIProvider. You should free such provider with
 *                  SOPC_PKIProvider_Free().
 *
 * \warning         The \p lPathTrustedIssuerLinks and \p lPathUntrustedIssuerLinks must be sorted:
 *                  certificates must be provided in the child ->  parent order.
 *                  In other words, there may be several chains provided in the list, but a signed certificate
 *                  must always be provided before the certificate that signed it.
 *
 * \note            Content of the pki is unspecified when return value is not SOPC_STATUS_OK.
 *
 * \note            The pki is not safe to share across threads.
