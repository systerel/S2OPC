/**
 * \brief           Creates the minimal validation implementation provided by the stack, which fulfills the PKIProvider
 * interface.
 *
 *                  This verifies the certificate in the safest manner (whole certificate chain, with date validation),
 *                  with a single certificate authority, and an optional revocation list.
 *                  It requires a certificate authority signed with SHA-256, and an RSA private key which is at least
 *                  2048 bits long.
 *
 * \warning         Provided certificates must be valid until the destruction of the created PKI (they are not copied).
 *
 * \param pCertAuth A valid pointer to the Certificate of the certification authority.
 * \param pRevocationList  An optional certificate chain containing the revocation list. If NULL, no revocation list is
 *                  checked.
 * \param ppPKI     A valid pointer to the newly created PKIProvider. You should free such provider with
 *                  SOPC_PKIProvider_Free().
 *
 * \note            Content of the pki is unspecified when return value is not SOPC_STATUS_OK.
 *
 * \note            The pki is not safe to share across threads.
 *
 * \return          SOPC_STATUS_OK when successful, SOPC_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETERS when parameters are NULL,
 *                  and SOPC_STATUS_NOK when there was an error.
