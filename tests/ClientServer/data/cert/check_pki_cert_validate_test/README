These certificates and CRL are used to test degraded cases of the PKI certificate validation process.
The CRL is a CRL issued by cacert, and it has not been renewed by it: it means that the field nextupdate of the CRL
is in the past.
ca_selfsigned_pathLen1 and ca_selfsigned_missingPathLen are self-signed CA designed to be used as both CA certificates and 
leaf certificates (client). They expire in 100 years, so that we don't have to re-generate them.
