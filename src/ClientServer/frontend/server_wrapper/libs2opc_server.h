/** \file
 *
 * \brief High level interface to run an OPC UA server.
 *
 * Once the server is configured using functions of libs2opc_server_config.h,
 * the server should be started using ::SOPC_ServerHelper_StartServer (or ::SOPC_ServerHelper_Serve).
 * Until it is stopped by call to ::SOPC_ServerHelper_StopServer or due to an error (listening address busy, etc.),
 * the server is then accessible for connections by OPC UA client applications
 * and local access/modification of address space content by server application itself.
 * This is done using same OPC UA services client are using but in a local way called "local services" in this server
 * API trough ::SOPC_ServerHelper_LocalServiceAsync (or ::SOPC_ServerHelper_LocalServiceSync)
 *
 * \note Local services:
 *  Local services are restricted to a minimal set of services to access or modify address space content without any
 * access restriction. This is the way to access or modify data of the server in the server application itself.
 *
 * \note When server is started, the configuration is freezed and the Server node content is initialized
