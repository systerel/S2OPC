/**
 * \brief Creates the PKIProvider from a directory where certificates are stored.
 *
 * The directory store shall be organized as follows:
 *
 * - \<Directory_store_name\>/trusted/certs (.DER or .PEM files)
 * - \<Directory_store_name\>/trusted/crl (.DER or .PEM files)
 * - \<Directory_store_name\>/issuers/certs (.DER or .PEM files)
 * - \<Directory_store_name\>/issuers/crl (.DER or .PEM files
 *
 * Optional updated trust list directory (for runtime update persistence) :
 *
 * - \<Directory_store_name\>/updatedTrustList/trusted/certs (.DER or .PEM files)
 * - \<Directory_store_name\>/updatedTrustList/trusted/crl (.DER or .PEM files)
 * - \<Directory_store_name\>/updatedTrustList/issuers/certs (.DER or .PEM files)
 * - \<Directory_store_name\>/updatedTrustList/issuers/crl (.DER or .PEM files)
 *
 * The function attempts to build the PKI from the updatedTrustList directory
 * and in case of error (missing, empty or malformed), it switches to the root trusted and issuers directories.
 *
 * Notions :
 * - CA is a root CA if it is self-signed.
 * - trusted/certs = trusted root CA + trusted link CA + trusted cert.
 * - trusted/crl = CRLs of the trusted root CA + trusted link CA.
 * - issuer/certs = untrusted root CA + untrusted link CA.
 * - issuer/crl = CRLs of the untrusted root CA + untrusted link CA.
 * - CAs from trusted/certs and issuers/certs allow to verify the signing chain of a cert which is included into
 *   trusted/certs.
 * - CAs from trusted/certs allow to verify the signing chain of a cert which is not included into trusted/certs.
 *
 * This function checks that :
 * - the number of certificates plus CRLs does not exceed \c SOPC_PKI_MAX_NB_CERT_AND_CRL .
 * - the certificate store is not empty.
 * - at least one trusted certificate is provided.
 * - each certificate from subfolder issuer/certs is CA.
 * - each CA has exactly one Certificate Revocation List (CRL).
 *
 * \note Content of the PKI is NULL when return value is not SOPC_STATUS_OK.
 *
 * \param directoryStorePath The directory path where certificates are stored.
 * \param[out] ppPKI A valid pointer to the newly created PKIProvider. You should free such provider with
 *                   ::SOPC_PKIProvider_Free().
 *
 * \return  SOPC_STATUS_OK when successful, SOPC_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETERS when parameters are NULL,
