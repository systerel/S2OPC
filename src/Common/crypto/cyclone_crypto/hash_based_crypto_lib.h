/**
 * \brief           Password-Based Key Derivation Function.
 *
 * \param pSecret           A valid pointer which contains the data to use when generating output.
 * \param lenSecret         Length of \p pSecret (bytes).
 * \param pSalt             A valid pointer which contains the salt when generating output.
 * \param lenSalt           Length of \p pSalt (bytes).
 * \param iteration_count   Desired iteration count (as large as possible).
 * \param ppOutput          A valid pointer to the newly created buffer which will contain the generated output.
 *                          You should free it.
 * \param lenOutput         Length of \p ppOutput desired.
 *
 * \note            \p lenSecret should not exceed 32 bytes because a secret longer than digest size
 *                  does not protect more, because, HMAC-SHA256 is considered to have 256 bits maximum input entropy.
 *
 * \note            You doesn't have to free the content of \p ppOutput when there is an error.
 *
 *
 * \return          SOPC_STATUS_OK when successful, SOPC_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETERS when parameters are NULL,
 *                  and SOPC_STATUS_NOK when there was an error (e.g. no entropy source).
